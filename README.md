# LangmuirKnudsenEvapModel

This is just a test-bed for evaluating the Langmuir-Knudsen I evaporation model from the 1998 paper by Miller et. al.

Each directory has its own individual source files and a run script. Simply running the shell script in each directory will compile and run the c++ code and open up a window for output. If the window doesn't open, just open the generated .png outputs from the script. 

Note: The shell script calls a python plotting script, which does have some hardcoded window sizes for the plots. You may need to change these for cases that you might want to run that are different from the ones in the directories.
